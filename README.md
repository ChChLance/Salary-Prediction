## Topic: Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data
##### Introduction: 
###### The level of salary can determine what kind of life a person can live as lower salaries come with more budgeting by the person. We are interested in the relation between peopleâ€™s attributes (education, race, age, etc) and their salary. After analyzing the data, we will then create a machine learning model to predict whether a person's salary will be greater than $50k a year.

##### Process:
###### 1. Data cleaning
###### 2. Variable selection
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;   - Correlation coefficient
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;   - Information Value
###### 3. Split data into training and testing data set
###### 4. Train models (We pick logistics regression, C5.0 decision tree, and SVM)
###### 5. Use K-fold to get the overall performance of models

##### Data source:
##### Data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income). This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau and it provides information like age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, hours per week, native country, etc.
