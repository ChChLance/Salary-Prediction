## Topic: Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data
#### Introduction: The level of salary can determine what kind of life a person can live as lower salaries come with more budgeting by the person. We are interested in the relation between peopleâ€™s attributes (education, race, age, etc) and their salary. After analyzing the data, we will then create a machine learning model to predict whether a person's salary will be greater than $50k a year.

#### Process:
#### 1. Data clean
#### 2. Variable selection
#### - Correlation coefficient
####   - Information Value 
#### Data source: Data set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/adult-census-income). This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau and it provides information like age, work class, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, hours per week, native country, etc.
